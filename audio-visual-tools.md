## content types in more detail

### 1. still image 
e.g. photography and graphics

#### pixels vs vectors
- https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pixel+vs+vector
- main advantages:
  - pixels e.g. photos can provide more depth/detail
  - vector graphics e.g. logos are easily scaleable

#### hardware/software for making
##### pixels
> "The best camera is the one you have." 
- [is it?](https://www.lightstalking.com/best-camera-one-with-you/)
- consider light composition first (more tips [here](https://www.lightstalking.com/best-camera-one-with-you/))
- if you can, shoot in RAW format to allow room for editing if needed
- try a few software, consider pricing and features. Search for 
  - 'Photoshop vs Gimp'
  - 'Photoshop alternatives'

#### sources for taking
- https://unsplash.com/images/stock
- https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/vector
- more? Search for 'free photography', 'free images' or 'free vector images', 'photo stock library' etc.
- you can also ask people on Flickr, Behance whether you could use their images
- remember to check the required attributions

## 2. audio
e.g. sound effect, music, podcast

### types of podcasts
1. simple interview or presentation recordings
   - more factual
   - example:
     - https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/
     - https://podcast.app/eckhart-tolle-essential-teachings-p687019/
  - sometimes its the audio only version of the original video format

2. storytelling with mixed material e.g. interviews, sound design and music and narration
   - more artistic
   - examples:
    - [Trickster The Many Lives of Carlos Castaneda](https://tricksterpodcast.com/)
    - [Good In Theory](https://goodintheorypod.com/)
    - [Song Exploder](https://songexploder.net/)

### microphones
- for quality recordings, use a condenser mic ([not a dynamic mic](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=condenser+vs+dynamic+mic))
- isolate noises as much as possible (unless they are part of your soundscape e.g. your storytelling)
- record in high sample rate 

### software
production stages:
  1. recording/sound design/composition
  2. editing
  3. mixing
  4. mastering
- big productions have different people for each of these stages, but can be done by one person as well of course
- stages can be done in one software e.g. Digital Audio Workstation e.g. like [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools), [Logic Pro](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/logic-pro/id634148309?mt=12), but sometimes its all mixed up e.g. recording can be done with portable recorders on SSD cards e.g. a [Zoom H1](https://www.zoom.co.jp/products/handy-recorder/h1-handy-recorder) or straight on the computer's HDD and mastering often uses specialist hardware tools as well

#### taking vs making
- pros. and cons.
- sources for taking: 
  - https://freesound.org/
  - more? search for 'audio stock libraries', 'free audio samples', 'free music', 'public domain music', etc.

4. screencast e.g. demonstrating the use of a specific software. Example: 
    - https://www.youtube.com/c/theschooloflifetv/videos

#### hardware
- smartphones, camcorders, video cameras, webcams (choose according to your project)
- inbuilt or external microphones (for better quality use external, condenser microphones)

#### software

  - limited to 15 minutes
  
- [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/)
  - [tutorial](https://youtu.be/QKmrDUJFRkM)
  - does not seem to be a good editing tool, but it's free and you can mix desktop + webcam and export in a variety of formats

- more? search for 'screencast software comparison'

##### video editing software
- Window Movie Maker
- Adobe Premier
- iMovie and Final Cut Studio

#### thoughts

<br><br><br>

### 4. text
- e.g. blog post, journal paper, book etc. 
#### software
- Word, MarkDown, etc. 
#### referencing

#### grammar
- before asking for feedback, check with Grammarly, ProWriting Aid, etc.

## Main take aways
- paid vs free software
- do it all or delegate
- less is more (e.g. simple transitions in video editing)
- record raw files and archive them for later
- keep assets for one project together, organised (have a convention for naming and organising your files)
