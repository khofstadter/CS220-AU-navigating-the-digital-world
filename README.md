The information in this repository expands on the [module description](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world/blob/main/assets/doc/CS220-4-and-CS220-5-AU%20-%20Krisztian%20Hofstadter-Mod%20Des%20FINAL%20(1).pdf).

The **weekly outline** of the seminars/workshops is in the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

<br>

## further clarification
The module aims to **help develop our digital identities** by introducing

1. White et al.'s [Visitor & Resident (V&R) method](digital-identities.md/#visitors-and-residents) (see Figure 1. below)
2. tools for project management, web design and hosting as well as audio-visual production
3. additional methods for sensemaking

<br><br><br>

While this module primarily focuses on providing practical skills, it also opens up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital identities and interactions e.g. by asking the following questions:

- how are we currently engaging with the Web, and how can we improve this?
- how can we develop and use our online identities e.g. with our own websites for 'better' engagement?
- what does 'better' engagement actually mean and how can we relate it to problem-solving?
- how can we use software tools to create assets e.g. audio-video content, to help disseminate information via our online identities more effectively?
- how can we apply critical thinking regarding the information we consume and produce?
- why should we produce information and whom should we address with this information i.e. who is our target audience?
- what is the change we would like to see in the world and how can we use our resident identities on the Web to support this change?

The module introduces primarily free and cross-platform software and, where possible, highlights their advantages and disadvantages to paid software. As the module in 2021 runs in labs equipped with Windows PCs, I demonstrate software in the workshops (and screencasts) using Windows 10 operating system (OS). However, I primarily use macOS, so I might switch sometimes. 
    
You will be able to use most of the software I introduce on the Lab PCs, but if you want you can install them on your own computers as well e.g. if you'd like to work from home instead of on these computers. 
  
_If you are not a first-year student, have you used the Student Union or the Media Centre creative studios on campus?_

_What software/hardware do you have experience with for creating or editing content with e.g. Photoshop, iMovie, microphones, video cameras, your phone with apps?_

_How many of you plan to use the PCs in these labs for coursework?_
<br>

2. website (40%)
    - a basic website for your professional identity or project

## log
- 2021-10-15 seminars done. Absent students emailed, some other admin regarding students changes. 
- 2021-10-12 simplified README.md and digital-identities.md. 
- 2021-10-08 added Zoom, Covid info to syllabus. Minimised the README.md file as it had info duplicating what is now in the portfolio template.
- 2021-10-05 tested Zoom with student computer and ZoomDave in lab G and created a list of things todo before the lessons starts, could be 10 minutes, so perhaps set a task for students? Also tested audio cable splitters that could be used with the student computers to records audio via a microphone and so far the Zoom H1 via mini jack is the best solution. Perhaps need to test with the small clip mic as well to have something close by. 
- 2021-09-30 added drafts to give examples for 'work in progress' i.e. 'practice what you preach'. Made a plain V&R image in InkScape and uploaded .svg format to assets folder as well. Small edits in texts.
- 2021-09-29 updated digital-identity.md with V&R part 1,2,3. Refined readme.md; minor edits to GitHub heading in tools.md.
- 2021-09-28 moved assessment info to assessment template repo. Enabled GitHub pages that considers the readme.md file as if it was an index.md file (great).
- 2021-09-21 added digital-identities.md and syllabus.md. Decided that each file should be written for a wider audience (e.g. Medium) to help raise the quality of writing.
- 2021-09-07 - 2021-09-21 textual and structural refinements
- 2021-09-07 repository created with basic info
  
 ## TODO
 This is Krisztian's todo list:

  - find out who Tolu and Joe was on Thu webinar

### by week 3
- screencasts for GitHub, VSC, GitHub Desktop
- password making
- make own V&R map
- shall students clone or download/upload the repo?
- brainstorm about other projects (performance in Hex?)


### by week 4
- screencast for GitHub vs Wordpress
- student examples for project idea

### by week 5
- screencast for audio-video and other production tools

### by week 6
- write an article about sensemaking

### by week 7
did I address all of these:
  - how are digital technologies transforming society?
  - to what extent do digital technologies curb or enhance our rights and freedom?
  - what digital skills are needed for the knowledge economy and a democratic society?
  - how might we use digital technologies as creative and engaging forms of communication?
