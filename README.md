The information in this repository expands on the [module description](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world/blob/main/assets/doc/CS220-4-and-CS220-5-AU%20-%20Krisztian%20Hofstadter-Mod%20Des%20FINAL%20(1).pdf).

## quick links

The **weekly outline** of the seminars/workshops is in the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

The [digital portfolio template](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-portfolio) explains what you need to submit and how in detail. 

<br>

## further clarification
The module aims to **help develop our digital identities** by introducing

1. White et al.'s [Visitor & Resident (V&R) method](digital-identities.md/#visitors-and-residents) (see Figure 1. below)
2. tools for project management, web design and hosting as well as audio-visual production
3. additional methods for sensemaking

<br><br><br>

While this module primarily focuses on providing practical skills, it also opens up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital identities and interactions e.g. by asking the following questions:

- how are we currently engaging with the Web, and how can we improve this?
- how can we develop and use our online identities e.g. with our own websites for 'better' engagement?
- what does 'better' engagement actually mean and how can we relate it to problem-solving?
- how can we use software tools to create assets e.g. audio-video content, to help disseminate information via our online identities more effectively?
- how can we apply critical thinking regarding the information we consume and produce?
- why should we produce information and whom should we address with this information i.e. who is our target audience?
- what is the change we would like to see in the world and how can we use our resident identities on the Web to support this change?

The module introduces primarily free and cross-platform software and, where possible, highlights their advantages and disadvantages to paid software. As the module in 2021 runs in labs equipped with Windows PCs, I demonstrate software in the workshops (and screencasts) using Windows 10 operating system (OS). However, I primarily use macOS, so I might switch sometimes. 
    
You will be able to use most of the software I introduce on the Lab PCs, but if you want you can install them on your own computers as well e.g. if you'd like to work from home instead of on these computers. 
  
_If you are not a first-year student, have you used the Student Union or the Media Centre creative studios on campus?_

_What software/hardware do you have experience with for creating or editing content with e.g. Photoshop, iMovie, microphones, video cameras, your phone with apps?_

_How many of you plan to use the PCs in these labs for coursework?_
<br>

- some are 1st and some 2nd-year students
- some only do AU, some only SP, some both
- most of you will be here in the class, Kevin on Zoom
  
<br>
    
_What are the advantages of having such a wide range of disciplines mixed in one group?_

<br>

## summary of module aims
To help 
- critically assess our current digital identities (with the V&R map and some additional theory)
- further develop our institutional (professional) digital identities by introducing tools/methods for
  - project management
  - logging
  - writing
  - web-design and web-hosting
  - audio-visual production

<br>

## assignment
In essence, the digital portfolio to submit has 4 parts: 
    
1. di-reflection (weighed as 40% of your overall mark)
    - reflection on how you can develop your digital identities
    - a short essay (words: between 750 - 1000 words)
2. website (40%)
    - a basic website for your professional identity or project
3. self-and peer-assessment (10%)
    - assessing your and someone else's progress with the marking rubric
4. portfolio overview (10%)
    - a submission with a clear/logical structure

## log
- 2021-11-04 thinking about how to move audio-visual tools to week 6 and perhaps not do the sensemaking class - but maybe that is very useful. 
- 2021-11-03 finalised week week 5's outlines e.g. syllabus, project managment and audio-visual tools. 
- 2021-10-29 started preparing week 5's outlines.  This included the use of available software on lab PCs.
- 2021-10-26 preparing website.md file and updating syllabus.  Also added some info to other drafts. 
- 2021-10-23 while trying to make screencasts on how to use VSC on the Lab PCs, two issues were encountered: 1. the SpellRight extension does not work; 2. the GitHub Desktop app didn't want to sycronise with the GitHub account using a browser. Being logged in with the browser first seemed promosing, but it didn't actually work either. 
- 2021-10-22 week 3 recap video sent to students. New (expiring) Facebook Group link sent via email to students (not compulsary). 
- 2021-10-19 week 3 syllabus simplified e.g. no VSC in class. Minor changes e.g. references in di-identity.md beautified. 
- 2021-10-16 GitHub sign up tested. 
- 2021-10-15 seminars done. Absent students emailed, some other admin regarding students changes. 
- 2021-10-12 simplified README.md and digital-identities.md. 
- 2021-10-08 added Zoom, Covid info to syllabus. Minimised the README.md file as it had info duplicating what is now in the portfolio template.
- 2021-10-05 tested Zoom with student computer and ZoomDave in lab G and created a list of things todo before the lessons starts, could be 10 minutes, so perhaps set a task for students? Also tested audio cable splitters that could be used with the student computers to records audio via a microphone and so far the Zoom H1 via mini jack is the best solution. Perhaps need to test with the small clip mic as well to have something close by. 
- 2021-09-30 added drafts to give examples for 'work in progress' i.e. 'practice what you preach'. Made a plain V&R image in InkScape and uploaded .svg format to assets folder as well. Small edits in texts.
- 2021-09-29 updated digital-identity.md with V&R part 1,2,3. Refined readme.md; minor edits to GitHub heading in tools.md.
- 2021-09-28 moved assessment info to assessment template repo. Enabled GitHub pages that considers the readme.md file as if it was an index.md file (great).
- 2021-09-21 added digital-identities.md and syllabus.md. Decided that each file should be written for a wider audience (e.g. Medium) to help raise the quality of writing.
- 2021-09-07 - 2021-09-21 textual and structural refinements
- 2021-09-07 repository created with basic info

## TODO
This is Krisztian's todo list:

### by week 6
- finish seminar notes on content production

#### add resources
- 4th V&R map video: https://youtu.be/5EyH-JZWtoI  (with comments)
#### sensemaking 
  - notes in bcmi/sensemaking draft (find RW pdf to fine tune notes in external HDD)
  - this could be for Medium linking CS220 AU to BCMI

#### presentations
- can you pull in project ideas from your other modules?
- Krystian Bucko from Innovation Centre Studio X
- Tom Morgan's SU presentation
- email from Rebecca Moss 
    
#### did I address all of these:
- how are digital technologies transforming society?
- to what extent do digital technologies curb or enhance our rights and freedom?
- what digital skills are needed for the knowledge economy and a democratic society?
- how might we use digital technologies as creative and engaging forms of communication?
<br><br>
    
### anytime
- (if possible) try to add the .svg file so it's centred

> Practice what you preach. (Plautus)
