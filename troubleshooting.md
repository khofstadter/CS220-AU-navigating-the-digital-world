Where, when and how to ask for help e.g. in person, in an email or on an online forum?

1. try your best with the information provided in the help files/FAQ
2. check on a forum whether a similar issue had been reported and try to follow suggestions (if there is any)
3. ask a question (be friendly and concise)
  1. state the issue 
  2. state what you have tried

- DIY vs asking for help (perhaps paying someone for help)
- long term vs short term
