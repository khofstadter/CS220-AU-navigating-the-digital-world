## GitHub 
1. Sign up to GitHub
 - you will need an email address
 - your username needs to be your student number
 - use a good password
2. Create a private repository
  - will be used for your private notes
  - name it 'notes'
  - when creating it add the `readme.md` file
3. Fork my 'CS220-AU-portfolio' repository
  - will be used for your digital portfolio (to submit)
  - you can turn some files in this repository into your website (or submit a website made with another CMS e.g. Wordpress)

### Markdown
Familiarise yourself with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) - there is a shortcut for this link in the file editor in your repository. <!-- #todo screenshot -->

### thoughts
- choose 'soft wrap' instead of 'no wrap' in the GitHub editor
- there are slightly different Markdown versions, but in general they all work the same (stick to the above if using with GitHub)
- we can monitor each others' progress in the public repositories. Please update it at least once a week. <!-- TODO: make example repo for private and public. Perhaps show examples of sonic art students from ARU. -->
- is GitHub safe to use e.g regarding tracking and cookies? [https://youtu.be/vAfBW1_AZkU?t=597](https://youtu.be/vAfBW1_AZkU?t=597)

### GitHub/Markdown combo for project management A/D

GitHub advantages:
- free
- provides version backup
- accessible on any mobil computing device that can use a browser on
- repositories can be synced to your computer (crossplatform)
- you can drag and drop images to the editor (but I think it's better to upload it them to your `assets` folder to stay organised)
- you can turn your files into a very fast website for free (can be static or more complex e.g. with Jekyll)

Markdown advantages:
- its simplicity helps focus on content
- if you can't find a Markdown function for your needs, you can extend your writing with HTML/CSS/JavaScript code

GitHub/Markdown disadvantages:
- for people not familiar with code, it might feel too technical (it's not!)
- if you work online as well as on the computer, you shouldn't forget to sync to avoid 

opportunities: 
- [project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards) - like [Trello](https://trello.com/)

<!-- #todo
- how to embed/create graphs in the markdown files in the repository e.g. in the `readme.md` file?
- we can give feedback on each work in GitHub in different ways e.g. by raising an 'Issue' or collaborating and suggesting changes <!-- #todo make screencast -->
-->

### addons
- if you have many files, hit the letter 't' and search for the file you want to edit
