## w2 module introduction and digital identities
- intro by Paula / AU clarification
- see DAVE and your PC

_Everyone logged in to Moodle? Did you find the link to this GitHub repository?_

- you are free to leave the room anytime you feel you need some fresh air/the toilet, etc. 
- we will try to have a 10 min break in the middle

_Have you received my email last week? Who wants to introduce him/herself?_

I can go first:

> Hello! My name is Krisztián Hofstädter, aka tEdör. I am a creative technologist working as a researcher, lecturer, freelancer, and artist. My primary interests are brain-computer music interfacing linked to meditation, electronic dance music and animal rights. I was born in Hungary and have been living in the U.K. since 2005. You can find most of my work on my personal website https://khofstadter.com/

### introduction and theory
- quick intro to syllabus
- [module introduction](README.md)
- 10 min break? (who has a class after this?)
- [digital identities](digital-identities.md)

### is this module for you?
In essence the module can help you 
- develop your engagement with the Web and your professional identity
- understand basic web design and make a free (fast) website
- with feedback from me and your class on your progress

### homework
- please send me your short introductions via email by next week's seminar
- start making your first V&R map on paper or in software (you can use the .svg file in the assets folder) - check the examples on White's [website](http://daveowhite.com/vandr/vr-mapping/)
- explore links in the [digital identities](digital-identities.md) file
- explore the [di-identities](https://krisztian-hofstadter-tedor.github.io/CS220-AU-portfolio/di-reflection.html) file in the CS220 portfolio template repository. It could give you ideas for your writing. (We will check this repository together next week.)
- consider joining the [CS220 Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/400596074925260) 
- consider creating an online group for yourself where you can discuss module related questions without me/university monitoring it

<br><br><br>

## w3 GitHub and Visual Code Studio
(ready by week 3)
### discuss progress / clarifications
- would you like to present your progress to your class?
- has anyone joined the Facebook group?
- do you need clarification on the `di-identity` assignment? 
- you should only use the Zoom webinars if your [request to study remotely](https://www.essex.ac.uk/student/covid-19/remote-study) was granted
- there is no official reading list, but there are many links and references in the files on this repository that I would encourage you to check
- if you need help with your English please visit [this page](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics/english-classes-for-dependants)

### GitHub
We will
- sign up to GitHub and create two repositories (a private and a public one)
- examine your new public repository, your own copy of the [digital portfolio template](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-portfolio)
- experiment with basic Markdown syntax in the GitHub editor e.g. headings, lists, bold, italics, hyperlinks
- start adding entries/ideas to the 'log' and the 'todo' headings in your portfolios

Please go to [tools/github](tools.md/#GitHub) - I will walk you through the setup. 

### Visual Code Studio
I will create screencasts for this software and how it can be used on the Lab PC soon. I will not introduce this software in the seminar as it might not be for everyone. 

### homework ideas
- start using your private and public repositories and get familiar with Markdown language
- make sure you use a private repository for your private notes (you can refine your writing in private and than move it to a public repository when/if ready)
- try [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) to see what data websites are trying to crawl from you (data mining)
- carry on working on your di-identity reflection (the essay)
