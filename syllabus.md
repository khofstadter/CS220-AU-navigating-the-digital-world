## w2 module introduction and digital identities

- intro by Paula / AU clarification
- see DAVE and your PC

_Everyone logged in to Moodle? Did you find the link to this GitHub repository?_

- you are free to leave the room anytime you feel you need some fresh air/the toilet, etc.
- we will try to have a 10 min break in the middle

_Have you received my email last week? Who wants to introduce him/herself?_

I can go first:

> Hello! My name is Krisztián Hofstädter, aka tEdör. I am a creative technologist working as a researcher, lecturer, freelancer, and artist. My primary interests are brain-computer music interfacing linked to meditation, electronic dance music and animal rights. I was born in Hungary and have been living in the U.K. since 2005. You can find most of my work on my personal website https://khofstadter.com/

<br>

### introduction and theory

- quick intro to the syllabus
- [module introduction](README.md)
- 10 min break? (who has a class after this?)
- [digital identities](digital-identities.md)

<br>

### is this module for you?

In essence, the module can help you

- develop your engagement with the Web and your professional identity
- understand basic web design and make a free (fast) website
- with feedback from me and your class on your progress

<br>

### homework

- please send me your brief introductions via email by next week’s seminar
- start making your first V&R map on paper or in software (you can use the .svg file in the assets folder) - check the examples on White’s [website](http://daveowhite.com/vandr/vr-mapping/)
- explore links in the [digital identities](digital-identities.md) file
- explore the [di-identities](https://krisztian-hofstadter-tedor.github.io/CS220-AU-portfolio/di-reflection.html) file in the CS220 portfolio template repository. It could give you ideas for your writing. (We will check this repository together next week.)
- consider joining the [CS220 Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/400596074925260) - ask me to reset the invitation.
- consider creating an online group for yourself where you can discuss module related questions without me/university monitoring it

<br><br><br>

## w3 GitHub and Visual Studio Code

### discuss progress / clarifications
- would you like to present your progress to your class?
- has anyone joined the Facebook group?
- do you need clarification on the `di-identity` assignment?
- you should only use the Zoom webinars if your [request to study remotely](https://www.essex.ac.uk/student/covid-19/remote-study) was granted
- there is no official reading list, but there are many links and references in the files on this repository that I would encourage you to check
- if you need help with your English language, please visit [this page](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics/english-classes-for-dependants)

<br>

### GitHub
We will
- sign up to GitHub and create two repositories (a private and a public one)
- examine your new public repository, your own copy of the [digital portfolio template](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-portfolio)
- experiment with basic Markdown syntax in the GitHub editor e.g. headings, lists, bold, italics, hyperlinks
- start adding entries/ideas to the ‘log’ and the ‘TODO’ headings in your portfolios
Please go to [tools/github](tools.md/#GitHub) - I will walk you through the setup.

<br>

### Visual Studio Code
You can find a short screen cast where I introduce this software [here](https://youtu.be/taFSpPeHs0o). If you need any help with setup, please let me know. 

<br>

### homework ideas
- start using your private and public repositories and get familiar with Markdown language
- make sure you use a private repository for your private notes (you can refine your writing in private and then move it to a public repository when/if ready)
- try [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) to see what data websites are trying to crawl from you (data mining)
- carry on working on your di-identity reflection (the essay)

<br><br><br>

## w4 websites and troubleshooting

### discuss progress / clarifications
- welcome Francesca and Maria - did you manage to catch up with the video I sent you?
- would you like to present your progress with your portfolio overview e.g. link + TODO lists?
- do you have questions regarding your assignment?
- if your GitHub account name is not your student number, [could you please amend it](https://youtu.be/5GQEf_5PSUs)?
- you don’t need to fork the ‘CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world’ repo (it might confuse things)
- please change the settings of your ‘notes’ repository to private if you haven’t yet
- did anyone check my [VSC](https://youtu.be/taFSpPeHs0o) video? Is anyone planning to use it? Do you need more info?

<br>

### websites
The [websites.md](websites.md) outlines
- some reasons to have a website
- two types of website builders: 
    1. static site generators (SSGs)
    2. web content management systems (WCMCs)
- the difference between textual and visual programming
- free WCMSs, with attention to WordPress
- custom domains
- how my website has changed over the years
- GitHub Pages (a free SSG)

<br>

### Your GitHub Pages website
- turn your ‘CS220-AU-portfolio’ repository into a GitHub Pages website in the repository’s `Settings/Pages` 
- add the website’s URL to the repository’s sidebar
- make some changes to the `index.md` file and wait for these changes to happen (sometimes takes seconds, sometimes minutes - which is one disadvantage when working on a GitHub Pages website in the GitHub editor using an internet browser). 

Some examples of changes you could make:
- replace my brief introduction with your brief introduction
- drop a small image file (JPG or PNG) to your repository’s `assets/img` folder and embed it in your `index.md` file
- change some hyperlinks
- embed another YouTube video

<br>

### discuss
- why is it good to have a website?
- how can it support your professional/institutional identity?
- what can you add to your website? Some ideas:
    - full CV / parts of your CV
    - project outlines, reports
    - blog e.g. using audio-video or/and textual content or just text e.g. your di-identity essay
    - links to social media profiles e.g LinkedIn
    - affiliations with organisations/institutions/clubs, etc. 
    - can you think of anything else?
- how does a website help our professional identities?
- what are efficient ways to use a website with social media accounts?
- how do I decide whether an SSG or a WCMS is best for a website?
- do I need new skills or do I have the money to pay someone to do the job for me? What are the advantages/disadvantages of these two options?
- why is it good to keep my information in raw text format i.e. as simple as possible?
- what are the advantages of LinkedIn over other social platforms? 

<br>

### troubleshooting
(note: screencast ready by the end of week 4)
- some simple ideas you could consider when troubleshooting i.e. solving a problem

<br>

### homework ideas
- consider how your website could benefit from audio-visual content
- experiment with adding content to your `index.md` file
- compare [Markdown and HTML](https://codingnconcepts.com/markdown/markdown-vs-html/)
- progress with your `di-identity` assignment

<br><br><br>
