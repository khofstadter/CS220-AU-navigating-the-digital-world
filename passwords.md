# Password management
Some [suggestions](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=password+best+practices+2021&t=brave&ia=web), from the Net:

**don't** use 
- words that can be found in dictionaries e.g. 'Lemon' or 'love'
- simple passwords e.g. '12345', 'aaaaaa' or '1234abcd'
- words that could be guessed from your social media profiles e.g. your dog's name
- the same password on different websites e.g. on Facebook and Twitter
- context-specific words e.g. 'instagram-ILOVEyou' on Instagram
- physical notebooks to store your passwords, software or online folders

use
- at least eight characters (but ideally more)
- longer instead of more complex passwords e.g. `correcthorsebatterystaple` is better than `Tr0ub4dor&3` (REF [1](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/03/nist-password-guidelines-2021-challenging-traditional-password-management/), [2](https://xkcd.com/936/))
- a good password manager app with a good password
- a mix of characters: 
  - capital letters e.g. 'C' (not as the first letter in your password as it is too common)
  - lower case letters e.g. 'w'
  - numbers e.g. '75'
  - symbols e.g. '<', '+', '>'

### thoughts
- 2021 recommendation: https://youtu.be/k_9suKBtIOQ
- complex and long passwords which don't use dictionary words are easy to forget
- a long password is still the best practice

### idea 1 (phrase+)
- a long and similar password for different websites, let's think:
1. goingtouniisgreatfunin2021
2. goingtoUniisgreatfunNtwenty21
3. going2UniIZgreatfunNtwenty21
4. gooingUniIZgreatfunNtwenty21
5. gooing2Uni IZgreatfunNtwenty21[+]
