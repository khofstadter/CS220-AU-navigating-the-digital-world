## editors/proofreaders
- remember that the books/articles you read were
    - written by someone
    - proofread and edited by someone else
- it's not usually one persons job

#Â Medium
- write (send via email and put on the website as well)
- try to get accepted in a one the publications (inhouse vs not inhouse)
- first academic paper, summarise in a medium publication 
- members can clap 50 times on an article (this translate into money) non member's money does not translate into money

## writing tips
- it's hard to get into - build up the momentum, be patient (sometimes coffee is not the best answer)
- write with flow first - edit later <!--#todo find writing styles -->
- set enough time aside
- create a routine/system
- don't work more than you should (it's not productive) - have breaks/work in intervals (perhaps link to a soundscape)
- have/maks deadlines 
- add physical exercise into the breaks
- turn of notifications
- find your personal drive (motivate yourself with your achievements or with other people's achievements and methods)
- write often and regularily
- have structure (headings/subheadings/lists)
- check grammar and typos with software
- match/create style e.g. by amending colours, padding, font, etc. 
- add images if they help illustrate something (make good graphs)
- hyperlinks, notes, references and bibliography
- add call to action hyperlinks if you want the reader to do something
### target audience related
- 15 seconds attention capture
- who who you write for and why
    - what will you provide i.e. how are your helping e.g. new information, summary of different information (relat info to other info), give a feeling (motivation)
    - every sentence and paragraphs needs to help the flow
    - write withouth fear, this is the best you can do now, and later of course this will change, as your knowledge will grow
