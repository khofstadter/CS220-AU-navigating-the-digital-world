- no need to know everything before you start/ship
- follow APM
- learn to fail, don't make it too personal i.e. distance your emotions from it perhaps by not being too attached to expected outcomes
- if you don't know what you want, start with what you don't want e.g. by making a list
- write content that is easy to change e.g. use raw text
- organise data chronologically, with EU data format and by using taxonomy e.g. categories i.e. groups/themes/types and tags - you could consider them as keywords as well 

## blogging and social media
- make once, share link, image and abstract (or subtitle) everywhere else
- traffic to point back to your website

## working with music
- don't listen to music with lyrics
- fit the tempo to your work
- if you are writing, try something minimal (fast or slow, but without many changes - make it gradually change not instantly)
- you could watch tutorial videos and listen to the narration and listen to your music in the background with lower volume (e.g. two youtube videos open, one music, one lecture)

## paid vs free
- paid often works 'better' - more user friendly, less bugs
- free you can often customise in more debth
- paid has trial versions (some with watermark) -
