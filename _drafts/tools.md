# Tools
## Visual Studio Code (VSC)
1. Install/launch the Visual Studio Code software on your computer
2. Make sure all of the following extensions are installed (some might need you to restart VSC or sometimes enabling when using a new folder/workstation e.g. when a GitHub repo is synced) :
  - Foam for VSCode (Wikilinks to Markdown)
  - GitHub Repositories
  - Markdown All in One (does not work with GitHub Repositories extension i.e. does not support virtual workstation)
  - Markdown Links
  - Markdown Notes
  - Markdown PDF
  - Spell Right
3. Sync your GitHub account to VSC
4. Make some changes to your `readme.md` file in VSC and commit to GitHub
 - check your changes in your GitHub account (with an internet browser)
<!-- TODO: do we need another markdown extension instead of Markdown All in One when working in virtual workstation? probably not if the main function we use this for is shortcuts e.g. bold, italics-->
  
### Thoughts
You can edit your files in both, you GitHub account via a browser or in VSC on your computer. The main advantages of using VSC are that
 - you can use VSC's extensions e.g. Spell Right (although in your own browser you could install browser extensions/plugins for this as well) or Foam that helps you organise your thoughts in a more creative, systematic way and 
 - VSC's editor itself provides further clarity e.g. with colour syntax an other tools e.g. search and replace for repetitive amendments
 - Markdown All in One's Table of Content function
 - option to export in PDF (customisable style in CSS)
 - once you have more notes you can use Jekyll (a static website generator) to create a novel website from your thoughts, writings and assets (e.g. images)

## GitHub Desktop
1. Lunch GitHub Desktop
2. Sign in to GitHub with the app
3. Clone a repository to the M drive
4. Open the cloned folder in VSC
5. Edit a file and save in VSC
6. Commit to master and push online
7. Check online for changes

## Foam 
https://foambubble.github.io/foam/
known issue: it does not work well when using the GitHub Repositories extension, because the one the essential extensions used for Foam, Markdown All in One does not work with virtual workspaces. So, the current idea is to use Foam with GitHub Desktop. To monitor issue: https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown/issues/996

- what info can I keep about others?

## Goal setting, planning & productivity
- how can a GitHub repo be used as a logbook?
- what is VSC?
- what is Foam?
- agile vs traditional project management
- less is more (keep it simple, edit your thoughts)
- consistency with file/folder naming
- additional tools e.g. physical notebook with BIC pen and/or simple note app on mobile phone
- alternative project management tools (which might be better for collaborations): Trello
- feedback from others
  
### Github Desktop

    - can edit online or local (demonstrate conflict)

## taxonomy

### software choice
- free/paid/subsription

- does it have a good community for support e.g an estabished forum
- are there examples that I can take apart
- are there examples of work similar to what I want to do?
